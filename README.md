# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualization
Introduction -:  Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithms specifies the way to arrange data in particular order. Most common orders are in numerical. The important of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level. Sorting is also used to represents data in more readable formats. Sorting is the basic building block that many other algorithms are built upon. Understanding how sorting visualization(animation) algorithm in Python work behind the scenes is a fundamental step toward implementing correct and efficient algorithms that solve real word problems.
We talk about sorting algorithms are 
1. Merge Sort.
2. Bubble Sort.
3. Insertion Sort.
4. Selection Sort.
•	Let’s talk about time complexity of four algorithms.
•	Merge sort Time complexity: O(n * Log n) in all 3 cases(worst, average and best).
•	Bubble sort time complexity: O(n) in best case and O(n ^ 2) in average and worst cases.
•	Insertion sort time complexity: O(n) in best case and O(n ^ 2) in average and worst cases.
•	Selection Sort time complexity: O(n ^ 2) in best case and O(1) worst case.
